# PictoRead
* PictoRead is an AI reading assistant that I build to make learning easier for everyone.
* When was the last time you read a physical book? Were you having difficulty understanding part of it? If so, try PictoRead!

# User Flow
* This is the user flow that I had in mind.
* The sceanario that I think this will apply are places like classrooms(where using personal smartphone is not preferred) that teachers can use this devices as an assistant, or when each individual tryng to learn something on their own and this devices can help them focus without the distraction from samrtphones.

# Hardware Platform
* The hardware will need a camera, a speaker, a display and of course the ability to process and access internet via WiFi.
* After some study, I have choosen Freenove Development Kit for ESP32_S3. It is available on Amazon for $60 (just do a simple search)

# Hardware Iterations
* V1 - just to prove things are working

* V2 - made it a bit more reliable for demo

# Software code
* Freenove does have a set of good tutorial code that makes development easier. I have uploaded my python code here as a reference.
* Note: you do need to set up your own http web service for Google Gemini or ChatGPT, I chose Gemini as it can read raw photos uploaded and provide good quality voice and picture outputs.
